# The Lab for Data Intensive Biology at UC Davis

See http://ivory.idyll.org/lab/

In addition to the pinned repositories within dib-lab, we also work on
and help maintain the following software:

[sourmash](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash/), for rapid large-scale sequence search.

[spacegraphcats](https://github.com/spacegraphcats/spacegraphcats/), for querying large annoying metagenome assembly graphs.
